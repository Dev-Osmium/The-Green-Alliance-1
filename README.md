# The Green Alliance
Team 4909's 2018+ Scouting System.

The Green Alliance Scouting Platform has been designed from the ground up to enable teams to share data beyond any event, district, or region. This influx of data is especially beneficial to teams at higher levels of play as they have more data to reference in strategic decisions and picking alliance partners. TGA consists of a cross-platform application and a community of FIRSTers willing to gather scouting data for the collective.

## Installation

### Raspberry Pi 3 Configuration (for offline TGA usage only)
1) Install [Raspbian Lite (not Desktop)](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) to your Raspberry Pi 3
2) Run `sudo raspi-config` to configure the correct keyboard layout and WiFi network (if not using ethernet)
4) Run `curl -sL http://thegreenalliance.team4909.org/INSTALL.sh | sudo -E bash -` on the Pi

    Please read the resulting output as it provides important information regarding configuration.
5) For Bluetooth usage, pair up to six Android devices [using the Terminal on the Pi OS](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-setup-bluetooth-on-a-raspberry-pi-3/)

### Android Devices (for online/offline TGA usage, enables Bluetooth -> Pi)
1) Enable [Installing via APK File](https://www.wikihow.tech/Install-APK-Files-on-Android)
2) Download & Install APK from `https://goo.gl/xoWPmL`

### Browser-based Scouting/Analysis Devices (Laptop/iOS devices)
Visit [thegreenalliance.team4909.org](http://thegreenalliance.team4909.org), and wait for the alert saying that the webpage has been cached. The app will save itself on your device and update whenever it is connected to the internet.

Note: this only occurs when there is a newer version of the site not yet cached

## Platform Architecture

### Syncing within the TGA Platform
All devices run either [CouchDB](https://github.com/apache/couchdb) or [PouchDB](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb) to store and sync data. The Bluetooth transfer protocol uses the [pouchdb-replication-stream](https://github.com/pouchdb-community/pouchdb-replication-stream) project to tunnel the API calls between the Kindle Fires and the Raspberry Pi CouchDB server.

When connected, devices will connect and sync data to reach [eventual consistency](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.1.1/intro/consistency.html).

<hr>

#### EDIT:
Due to time constraints, the Bluetooth transfer protocol will **not** support bidirectional communication for the 2018 competition season.

### Hosted Infrastructure
- Web Hosting via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
- CouchDB on Azure VM

### Offline Usage
All data will be replicated locally in PouchDB or CouchDB, while the website will be cached for offline access using HTML5 [AppCache](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Using_the_application_cache)
<!--and [Service Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers).-->

### Third-Party Data
To help scouts, TGA will reference third-party APIs to obtain team names, event schedules and official match results using the [TBA API v3](https://github.com/fletch3555/tba-api-client-javascript) and [FMS Events API v2](https://frcevents2.docs.apiary.io/#). If internet access is not available or should circumstances change, manual override will also be supported.

### Accessing the Database
To leverage the data collected by TGA for additional analysis, you may __replicate__ from the TGA CouchDB server using your existing credentials. The data is stored in a [JSON](https://www.json.org) format.

TGA CouchDB Server: `tga-cloud.team4909.org:5984`

If you need credentials, please contact us at `team4909@gmail.com`
